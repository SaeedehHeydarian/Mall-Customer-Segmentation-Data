# Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

## Overview
This project is created solely for the purpose of demonstrating customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis. The goal is to apply the KMeans Clustering algorithm to group customers with similar purchasing patterns into distinct segments. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and overall business growth.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis contains basic data about 
- your customers like Customer ID
- age, gender
- annual income
-  spending score.. 

## Code Description
The main script `customer_segmentation.py` performs the customer segmentation using KMeans Clustering. The key steps in the code are as follows:
1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Feature scaling.
3. Determining the optimal number of clusters (K).
4. Applying KMeans Clustering to group customers into segments.
5. Analyzing and visualizing the clustered data.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have installed all the prerequisites mentioned above.
2. Run the script `customer_segmentation.py`.

## Results
The customer segmentation analysis has identified [5 cluster ]. Detailed visualizations are available in the results folder.
